                <p class="text-yellow-700">A heightened form of duty that requires a defendant not only to take reasonable care themselves, but to ensure that reasonable care is taken by anyone performing functions on their behalf - creating liability for independent contractors&#39; negligence in specific circumstances.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Underlying Rationale</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The doctrine recognizes that in certain relationships characterized by vulnerability and dependency, it would be unjust to allow duty-bearers to escape liability by delegating critical functions to third parties. It ensures accountability where one party has assumed responsibility for another&#39;s safety or welfare.</p>
