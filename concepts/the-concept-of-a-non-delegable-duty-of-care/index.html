                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The doctrine recognizes that in certain relationships characterized by vulnerability and dependency, it would be unjust to allow duty-bearers to escape liability by delegating critical functions to third parties. It ensures accountability where one party has assumed responsibility for another&#39;s safety or welfare.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-indigo-800 mb-3">Hypothetical Example</h3>
                
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h4 class="font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-2">Scenario:</h4>
                    <p class="text-indigo-600 leading-relaxed">A local authority contracts with an independent company to provide safety inspections of school playground equipment as part of its statutory duty to ensure pupil safety. The inspection company negligently fails to identify a dangerous defect in a climbing frame, and a child is seriously injured when the equipment collapses. The inspection company becomes insolvent before legal proceedings can be concluded.</p>
                </div>
                
                
                <div>
                    <h4 class="font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-2">Legal Outcome:</h4>
                    <p class="text-indigo-600 leading-relaxed">The local authority would likely be held liable under a non-delegable duty of care. The child is vulnerable and dependent on the authority for safety; the authority has statutory custody/care obligations; the child has no control over inspection arrangements; safety inspection is integral to the authority&#39;s protective duty; and the inspection company was negligent in performing the delegated safety function. The authority cannot escape liability despite delegating to a competent independent contractor who became insolvent.</p>
                </div>
                
            </div>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-800 mb-3">For Clients</h3>
                    <p class="text-green-700 leading-relaxed">A non-delegable duty means you remain legally responsible for ensuring certain functions are performed properly, even when you hire independent contractors to do the work. This applies mainly when you have special responsibility for vulnerable people (like children, patients, or employees) and you delegate safety-critical functions. Unlike normal situations where you&#39;re only liable if you choose contractors carelessly, non-delegable duties make you liable even if you pick competent contractors who then act negligently. This creates significant insurance and indemnity implications when contracting out core functions.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-800 mb-3">For Lawyers</h3>
                    <p class="text-purple-700 leading-relaxed">Non-delegable duties represent the highest form of tort liability short of strict liability, requiring satisfaction of Woodland&#39;s five-stage test. Key analytical steps: assess vulnerability and dependency relationships; identify whether function delegated is integral to defendant&#39;s assumed protective duty; distinguish between defendant&#39;s duty and third party&#39;s separate obligations; consider policy factors affecting fair, just and reasonable test. Practical implications include insurance coverage gaps, indemnity clause importance, and careful selection of functions suitable for delegation. Consider interaction with vicarious liability principles and contribution rights.</p>
