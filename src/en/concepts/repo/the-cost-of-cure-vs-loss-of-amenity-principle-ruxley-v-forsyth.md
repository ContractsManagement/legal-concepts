concept:
  principleName: "The 'Cost of Cure' vs. 'Loss of Amenity' Principle (Ruxley v Forsyth)"
  aliases: ["Ruxley Electronics Principle","Reasonable Reinstatement Test","Proportionality in Damages Principle","Consumer Surplus Compensation"]
  primaryJurisdiction: "England & Wales"
  fieldOfLaw: "Construction Law - Remedies and Damages"
  coreConcept:
    elevatorPitch: "A judicial doctrine establishing that damages for construction defects should be measured by cost of cure only where reinstatement is reasonable and proportionate; where cure costs are disproportionate to the benefit gained, courts may award modest damages for loss of amenity instead."
    underlyingRationale: "The principle prevents unjust enrichment while recognizing that contractual promises have value beyond mere financial enhancement. It balances the fundamental rule that damages should put the innocent party in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed, against the need for proportionate and reasonable remedies."
  discovery:
    origin:
      type: "Common Law (judicial decision)"
      landmarkCase: "Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth [1996] AC 344 (HL)"
      summary: "House of Lords established that where cost of rectifying construction defects is wholly disproportionate to any benefit obtained, courts should award damages for loss of amenity rather than full reinstatement costs, even where no diminution in value can be proven."
    evolution: [{"caseName":"County Court (Judge Diamond QC)","year":1993,"contribution":"Original trial judge awarded £2,500 for loss of amenity rather than £21,560 reinstatement costs for swimming pool depth shortfall, establishing precedent for reasonable approach to construction damages."},{"caseName":"Court of Appeal reversal","year":1994,"contribution":"Court of Appeal initially overturned trial decision, holding that damages should automatically equal cost of cure where contract not performed as agreed, demonstrating tensions in damages principles."},{"caseName":"Farley v Skinner [2001] UKHL 49","year":2001,"contribution":"House of Lords extended Ruxley principles to surveyor negligence, confirming availability of damages for non-pecuniary loss where parties contemplated peace of mind as contractual objective."}]
  deconstruction:
    essentialElementsTest: [{"element":"Proven Contractual Breach","description":"There must be established breach of contract where performance differs from contractual specifications, even if the difference does not affect functionality or value."},{"element":"Disproportionate Reinstatement Cost","description":"The cost of rectifying the defect must be wholly disproportionate to any prospective benefit the claimant would obtain from reinstatement work."},{"element":"Substantial Achievement of Purpose","description":"The contractual objective must have been achieved to a substantial extent, with the defect being relatively minor in the context of overall performance."},{"element":"Consumer Surplus Recognition","description":"The claimant must have suffered some loss of enjoyment, satisfaction, or amenity that justifies compensation beyond nominal damages."}]
