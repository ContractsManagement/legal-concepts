concept:
  principleName: "The Principles Governing 'Total Cost' Claims"
  aliases: ["Total Cost Method","Cost Overrun Claims","Modified Total Cost Claims"]
  primaryJurisdiction: "England & Wales"
  fieldOfLaw: "Construction Law - Claims and Disputes"
  coreConcept:
    elevatorPitch: "A damages calculation method comparing total actual project costs against total budgeted costs to establish loss, used when traditional cost build-up is impractical but requiring proof that excess costs resulted from compensable events rather than contractor inefficiency."
    underlyingRationale: "Total cost claims recognize that in complex disrupted projects, tracking specific costs to specific causes may be impractical, while requiring claimants to prove that cost overruns resulted from compensable events rather than their own performance failures."
  discovery:
    origin:
      type: "Common Law and Arbitration Practice"
      landmarkCase: "Serck Controls Ltd v Drake & Scull Engineering Ltd (2000) 73 Con LR 100"
      summary: "English court addressed total cost methodology, emphasizing need to establish causal connection between compensable events and cost overruns while excluding contractor's own inefficiencies."
    evolution: [{"caseName":"Various US federal contracting cases","year":1970,"contribution":"US courts developed strict requirements: actual costs were reasonable; tender was realistic; excess costs caused by defendant's breaches; claimant not responsible for cost overruns."},{"caseName":"Modern construction arbitrations","year":2000,"contribution":"Arbitrators increasingly accept modified total cost approaches where some cost breakdown is possible, reducing reliance on pure total cost methodology."}]
  deconstruction:
    essentialElementsTest: [{"element":"Reasonable Actual Costs","description":"The costs actually incurred must be reasonable and properly documented, excluding wasteful or inefficient expenditure."},{"element":"Realistic Original Budget","description":"The original tender or budget must have been realistic and based on accurate information available at the time."},{"element":"Compensable Causation","description":"The cost overrun must be caused by compensable events (employer breaches, variations, etc.) rather than contractor performance failures."},{"element":"No Contractor Responsibility","description":"The claimant must not be responsible for the cost overruns through their own inefficiency, poor planning, or contractual breaches."}]
