    elevatorPitch: "A strict liability rule holding persons liable for damage caused when dangerous substances escape from their land during non-natural use, regardless of fault or negligence - creating absolute liability for certain construction activities involving hazardous materials or operations."

      type: "Common Law (judicial decision)"
