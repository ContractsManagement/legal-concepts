concept:
  principleName: "The Implied Duty of Fitness for Purpose"
  aliases: ["Fitness for Purpose Obligation","Warranty of Fitness for Purpose","Strict Duty of Result"]
  primaryJurisdiction: "England & Wales"
  fieldOfLaw: "Construction Law - Contractual Obligations"
  coreConcept:
    elevatorPitch: "An absolute contractual duty requiring construction professionals to ensure their design or completed works achieve the intended purpose, regardless of the level of skill, care, or effort applied - creating liability even without negligence."
    underlyingRationale: "The doctrine shifts risk allocation from the employer to the contractor/designer where the employer has relied on the professional's expertise to deliver a specific outcome. It protects clients who lack technical expertise to assess process rather than merely results, particularly where the professional has held themselves out as capable of achieving the intended purpose."

      type: "Common Law (implied terms) and Statute (Sale of Goods Act 1979)"
      landmarkCase: "Young & Marten Ltd v McManus Childs Ltd [1969] 1 AC 454"
      summary: "Established that contractors supplying materials impliedly warrant their fitness for purpose unless expressly excluded, extending Sale of Goods Act principles to construction contracts."
    evolution: [{"caseName":"IBA v EMI Electronics and BICC Construction Ltd","year":1980,"contribution":"Clarified that design and build contractors owe fitness for purpose obligations for design elements unless contract terms limit liability to reasonable skill and care standard."},{"caseName":"Greaves & Co (Contractors) Ltd v Baynham Meikle & Partners","year":1975,"contribution":"Established that where a contractor undertakes design responsibility and the intended purpose is made known, fitness for purpose obligation is implied even for professional services."},{"caseName":"MT HÃ¸jgaard A/S v E.ON Climate & Renewables UK Robin Rigg East Limited","year":2017,"contribution":"Supreme Court confirmed fitness for purpose obligations can arise even where design complies with applicable standards, emphasizing the absolute nature of the duty and insurance implications."}]
