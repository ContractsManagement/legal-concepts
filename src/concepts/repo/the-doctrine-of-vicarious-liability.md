concept:
  principleName: "The Doctrine of Vicarious Liability"
  aliases: ["Respondeat Superior","Imputed Liability","Employer Liability for Employee Acts","Master and Servant Liability"]
  primaryJurisdiction: "England & Wales"
  fieldOfLaw: "Construction Law - Tort Liability"
  coreConcept:
    elevatorPitch: "A strict liability doctrine that holds employers automatically responsible for tortious acts committed by employees during the course of their employment, extending liability beyond the actual wrongdoer to parties with deeper pockets and insurance coverage."
    underlyingRationale: "The doctrine serves multiple policy objectives: ensuring adequate compensation for victims by targeting defendants with greater financial resources; incentivizing employers to exercise proper supervision and control over employees; and recognizing that employers benefit from employee activities and should bear associated risks."
  discovery:
    origin:
      type: "Common Law (judicial development)"
      landmarkCase: "Joel v Morison (1834) 6 C & P 501"
      summary: "Established foundational principle that masters are liable for servants' acts performed in course of employment, even where master had no knowledge or approval of the specific act causing harm."
    evolution: [{"caseName":"Limpus v London General Omnibus Co (1862) 1 H & C 526","year":1862,"contribution":"Extended vicarious liability to acts expressly forbidden by employer, establishing that prohibition does not necessarily take conduct outside course of employment if closely connected to authorized duties."},{"caseName":"Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam [2002] UKHL 48","year":2002,"contribution":"House of Lords modernized test for vicarious liability by focusing on 'close connection' between employment and wrongful act, moving away from rigid 'course of employment' formulation."},{"caseName":"Various Claimants v WM Morrison Supermarkets [2020] UKSC 12","year":2020,"contribution":"Supreme Court clarified limits of vicarious liability, holding employer not liable for employee's personal vendetta despite using work facilities, emphasizing need for genuine connection to employment role."}]
  deconstruction:
    essentialElementsTest: [{"element":"Employment or Akin Relationship","description":"There must be an employment relationship or relationship 'akin to employment' between defendant and tortfeasor, assessed through factors including control, integration, and mutual obligation."},{"element":"Tortious Act by Employee","description":"The employee must have committed a recognized tort (negligence, trespass, etc.) causing harm to a third party - vicarious liability does not create new causes of action."},{"element":"Close Connection Test","description":"The wrongful act must be so closely connected with authorized acts that it can fairly be regarded as done in course of employment, even if expressly prohibited."},{"element":"Third Party Harm","description":"The tortious act must cause harm to someone other than the employer - employers cannot be vicariously liable to themselves for employee acts."}]
