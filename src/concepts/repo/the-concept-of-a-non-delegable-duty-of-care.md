concept:
  principleName: "The Concept of a Non-Delegable Duty of Care"
  aliases: ["Non-Delegable Duty of Care","Personal Duty of Care","Woodland v Essex Principle","Duty to Ensure Care is Taken"]
  primaryJurisdiction: "England & Wales"
  fieldOfLaw: "Construction Law - Tort Liability"
  coreConcept:
    elevatorPitch: "A heightened form of duty that requires a defendant not only to take reasonable care themselves, but to ensure that reasonable care is taken by anyone performing functions on their behalf - creating liability for independent contractors' negligence in specific circumstances."
    underlyingRationale: "The doctrine recognizes that in certain relationships characterized by vulnerability and dependency, it would be unjust to allow duty-bearers to escape liability by delegating critical functions to third parties. It ensures accountability where one party has assumed responsibility for another's safety or welfare."
  discovery:
    origin:
      type: "Common Law (judicial development)"
      landmarkCase: "Woodland v Essex County Council [2013] UKSC 66"
      summary: "Supreme Court established comprehensive framework for non-delegable duties, holding that a school owed pupils a non-delegable duty to ensure swimming lessons were conducted with reasonable care, creating liability for independent swimming instructor's negligence."
