concept:
  principleName: "The Legal Status of a Condition Precedent"
  aliases: ["Condition Precedent","Precedent Condition","Conditional Obligations","Suspensive Conditions"]
  primaryJurisdiction: "England & Wales"
  fieldOfLaw: "Construction Law - Contract Performance"
  coreConcept:
    elevatorPitch: "A contractual requirement that must be fulfilled before a party's obligation to perform becomes due, creating suspended rights and obligations that only become enforceable upon condition satisfaction."
    underlyingRationale: "Conditions precedent allow parties to make performance contingent on specific events, protecting against unwanted obligations while providing certainty about when duties arise and potential escape routes if conditions fail."
  discovery:
    origin:
      type: "Common Law (contractual construction)"
      landmarkCase: "Trans Trust SPRL v Danubian Trading Co Ltd [1952] 2 QB 297"
      summary: "Court of Appeal established distinction between conditions precedent to formation of contract versus conditions precedent to performance of existing contractual obligations."
    evolution: [{"caseName":"Pym v Campbell (1856) 6 E&B 370","year":1856,"contribution":"Established that conditions precedent to contract formation prevent any contractual obligations arising until condition satisfied, distinguished from conditions precedent to performance."},{"caseName":"Coloroll Pension Trustees Ltd v Russell [1994] 4 All ER 33","year":1994,"contribution":"House of Lords clarified that conditions precedent to performance suspend existing obligations rather than preventing contract formation, affecting remedy availability."}]
  deconstruction:
    essentialElementsTest: [{"element":"Clear Conditional Language","description":"Contract must use clear language showing obligation is conditional ('if', 'provided that', 'subject to', 'on condition that') rather than merely descriptive."},{"element":"Identifiable Condition","description":"The condition must be precisely defined and objectively ascertainable, avoiding vague or subjective requirements that create uncertainty."},{"element":"Logical Connection to Obligation","description":"There must be clear connection between the condition and the obligation it governs - condition must be relevant to performance trigger."},{"element":"Possibility of Non-Fulfillment","description":"The condition must be capable of not being satisfied - automatic or inevitable events cannot function as true conditions precedent."}]
