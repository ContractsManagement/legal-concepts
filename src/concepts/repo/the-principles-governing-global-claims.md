concept:
  principleName: "The Principles Governing 'Global Claims'"
  aliases: ["Total Cost Claims","Rolled-Up Claims","Composite Claims","Cumulative Claims"]
  primaryJurisdiction: "England & Wales"
  fieldOfLaw: "Construction Law - Claims and Disputes"
  coreConcept:
    elevatorPitch: "A method of claiming additional costs where multiple causes of delay and disruption are so interlinked that their individual effects cannot be practically separated, allowing recovery based on total impact rather than cause-by-cause analysis."
    underlyingRationale: "Global claims recognize the practical reality that in complex construction projects, multiple concurrent causes of delay and disruption create synergistic effects that are impossible to separate precisely, while still requiring sufficient causal connection to justify recovery."
  discovery:
    origin:
      type: "Common Law (judicial development)"
      landmarkCase: "Crosby (J) & Sons Ltd v Portland UDC (1967) 5 BLR 121"
      summary: "First recognition that where multiple causes of delay are so complex and interrelated that separation is impractical, global claims may be acceptable if overall causal connection established."
    evolution: [{"caseName":"Mid Glamorgan County Council v J Devonald Williams & Partner (1992) 29 Con LR 129","year":1992,"contribution":"Established that global claims require proof of causation between events claimed for and loss suffered, rejecting purely arithmetical approaches."},{"caseName":"John Doyle Construction Ltd v Laing Management (Scotland) Ltd [2004] BLR 295","year":2004,"contribution":"Scottish court clarified that global claims must still establish causal connection and cannot be used simply to avoid burden of detailed analysis where separation is possible."}]
  deconstruction:
    essentialElementsTest: [{"element":"Multiple Concurrent Causes","description":"There must be multiple events or causes of delay/disruption that occurred during overlapping periods."},{"element":"Practical Impossibility of Separation","description":"It must be genuinely impractical to separate the individual effects of different causes due to their complex interaction."},{"element":"Overall Causal Connection","description":"There must be proven causal link between the events claimed for and the total loss suffered, even if individual contributions cannot be quantified."},{"element":"Detailed Record of Events","description":"Comprehensive contemporaneous records of all events and their timing must be available to support the global approach."}]
