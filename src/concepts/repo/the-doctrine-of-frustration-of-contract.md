concept:
  principleName: "The Doctrine of Frustration of Contract"
  aliases: ["Frustration of Purpose","Supervening Impossibility","Discharge by Frustration","Taylor v Caldwell Doctrine"]
  primaryJurisdiction: "England & Wales"
  fieldOfLaw: "Construction Law - Contract Termination"
  coreConcept:
    elevatorPitch: "A legal doctrine that automatically terminates contracts when supervening events render performance impossible or radically different from what was originally contemplated, without fault of either party - providing escape from contractual obligations when circumstances fundamentally change."
    underlyingRationale: "The doctrine prevents harsh outcomes where parties would otherwise remain bound by impossible or fundamentally altered obligations due to unforeseeable events. It recognizes that contracting parties cannot anticipate every possible circumstance and provides relief where continued performance would be unjust or meaningless."
  discovery:
    origin:
      type: "Common Law (judicial development)"
      landmarkCase: "Taylor v Caldwell (1863) 3 B & S 826"
      summary: "Established frustration doctrine when music hall burnt down before contracted concerts, holding parties discharged from performance where subject matter destroyed without fault. This created exception to absolute contractual obligations principle from Paradine v Jane."
    evolution: [{"caseName":"Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban District Council [1956] AC 696","year":1956,"contribution":"Lord Radcliffe provided classic definition: frustration occurs when performance becomes incapable due to circumstances rendering it radically different from what was undertaken by the contract."},{"caseName":"Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943","year":1943,"contribution":"Statutory framework for consequences of frustration, allowing courts discretionary powers to apportion losses and provide monetary awards that achieve justice between parties."},{"caseName":"National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Ltd [1981] AC 675","year":1981,"contribution":"House of Lords confirmed frustration can apply to leases and established that temporary impossibility insufficient unless it effectively destroys the contract's commercial purpose."}]
  deconstruction:
    essentialElementsTest: [{"element":"Supervening Event","description":"An event must occur after contract formation that was not contemplated by the parties and could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of contracting."},{"element":"Impossibility or Radical Change","description":"The event must render performance impossible or so fundamentally different that it would be unjust to hold parties to their original obligations."},{"element":"No Party Fault","description":"The frustrating event must not be due to the fault, act, or election of either party - self-induced frustration provides no relief."},{"element":"No Contractual Provision","description":"The contract must not contain express provisions dealing with the supervening event, as force majeure or similar clauses exclude frustration doctrine."}]
